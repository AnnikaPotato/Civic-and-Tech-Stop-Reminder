# Civic-and-Tech-Stop-Reminder

A notification mod for Sid Meier's Civilization VI. At the beginning of each turn, if you have a ongoing tech and/or civic which does not receive a boost from eureka/inspiration, and is estimated to be finished if receiving a boost, you will receive a pop-up notification so you will not miss the timing to change it.
